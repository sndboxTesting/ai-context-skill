## 7. Needs Human Review — Proposed Fixes

### FIX-001: file_search regex too broad — swallows cleanup/duplicates/large_files
**Impact:** ~2 scenarios | **Effort:** low | **Confidence:** high

**Root Cause:** `\b(find|search for|locate|look for)\b.{0,20}\bfiles?\b` matches 'find things to delete', 'find duplicate files', 'find large files'. The word 'files' appears in disk management prompts but should not trigger file_search.

**Proposed Fix:**
```
Add negative lookahead to file_search pattern: require file path context (extension, directory, 'in workspace', 'in /path') OR remove 'find' as standalone trigger. Alternative: add pre-guards for duplicate/cleanup intents BEFORE file_search in REGEX_INTENTS.
```

**File:** `adwi/adwi_cli.py — _REGEX_INTENTS file_search section`

**Evidence:**
  - `find my heaviest files`
  - `find dupkicates`

### FIX-005: organize → chat/file_search LLM miss
**Impact:** ~5 scenarios | **Effort:** low | **Confidence:** medium

**Root Cause:** organize intent has no explicit rule in _INTENT_SYSTEM. LLM sees 'help me organize files' as advisory chat, and sometimes as file_search. The regex covers 'organiz/tidy/restructure' but not all advisory phrasing.

**Proposed Fix:**
```
Add to _INTENT_SYSTEM: 'organize: user wants help organizing, sorting, restructuring, or tidying their file/folder hierarchy. Different from cleanup (deletion) and file_search (finding files).'
```

**File:** `adwi/adwi_cli.py — _INTENT_SYSTEM`

**Evidence:**
  - `what's the best way to structure these files`
  - `help organize my workspace`
  - `how to structure my project folders`
  - `how to organize dev projects`
  - `organize`

### FIX-006: benchmark regex too narrow — misses 'how fast is my model'
**Impact:** ~7 scenarios | **Effort:** low | **Confidence:** high

**Root Cause:** Current benchmark regex requires 'adwi|model|local|ollama' in the same phrase as 'benchmark|speed test|how fast|tokens per second'. Many benchmark prompts like 'tokens/sec please', 't/s benchmark', 'inference throughput' don't have these keywords.

**Proposed Fix:**
```
Add: `(tokens?/s|t/s|tok/s|throughput).{0,20}(model|llm|ollama|adwi)?` → benchmark
And: `(inference|llm|model|ollama).{0,20}(speed|throughput|latency|benchmark)` → benchmark
And: `how fast.{0,20}(llm|model|is adwi|is ollama)` → benchmark
```

**File:** `adwi/adwi_cli.py — _REGEX_INTENTS`

**Evidence:**
  - `how fast is adwi responding`
  - `how fast is llama3.1:8b`
  - `my local AI model is responding much slower than usual what could be causing this and how do i benchmark it`
  - `how fast is llama3.1 on this machine`
  - `what's my inference speed`

## 8. Prioritized Repair Backlog
Ordered by (estimated_impact × confidence / effort):

1. **FIX-006** — benchmark regex too narrow — misses 'how fast is my model' (~7 scenarios)
2. **FIX-005** — organize → chat/file_search LLM miss (~5 scenarios)
3. **FIX-001** — file_search regex too broad — swallows cleanup/duplicates/large_files (~2 scenarios)

## Appendix: Gmail Burn-in Stage 3 Update (2026-06-17)

**New baselines after Gmail burn-in (Stages 1–3):**

| Eval | Scenarios | Previous | After burn-in | Gain |
|------|-----------|----------|---------------|------|
| P1 | ~1,619 | 90.7% | **92.0%** | +1.3pp |
| P2 | 561 | 83.9% | **87.2%** | +3.3pp |
| Combined | ~2,180 | 89.0% | **90.7%** | +1.7pp |

**Patches applied:**
- Stage 1 (Phase B/C): 12 FIX-STRESS patches — gmail schedule/send/compose/draft/attachment/inbox/mutation NLU coverage
- Stage 2 (stress suite): 317-test Gmail stress suite (`adwi/simlab/tests/test_gmail_burnin.py` + `test_gmail_stress.py`)
- Stage 3 (final repair): 4 FIX-STAGE3 patches — `open the latest message`→gmail_read, `which draft has the PDF attached`→gmail_list_drafts, `send an email to X`→gmail_compose, `send the email`→gmail_send_draft

**Remaining Gmail failures (16/1619 P1, 1/561 P2) — all pre-existing or LLM routing:**
- `gmail_summarize→gmail` (3): bare "this email" prompts hit gmail catch-all first (ordering constraint)
- LLM-routed failures (7): gmail_confirm→chat, gmail_add_cc/bcc→gmail, gmail_save_attachment→file_save, gmail_schedule_send→nightly_status, gmail_list_category→obsidian_search
- `gmail_tasks_save→obsidian_daily`, `memory_recall→gmail_followup_reminder` (2): pre-existing cross-intent bleed

**Safety constraints honored:** No live mailbox mutations, no real sends, no credential changes, no security boundary weakening throughout all burn-in stages.

## Appendix C — Stabilization Sprint (2026-06-17)

**Branch:** `nlu-stabilize-2026-06-17` → merged to `main`
**Goal:** Eliminate chat bleed (~30 P1 failures), fix benchmark family (~6), fix organize family (~4).
**Result:** P1 92.6%, P2 88.8%, Combined ~91.7% (+1.0pp from Gmail burn-in baseline).

### Patches applied

| Fix ID | Family | Approach |
|--------|--------|----------|
| FIX-SPRINT-001a/b/c | benchmark | `how fast is [model]`, tokens/sec, inference speed/perf guards before status |
| FIX-SPRINT-002 | what_next | `generate ideas for adwi`, `brainstorm improvements`, `low-hanging fruit` guards before capabilities |
| FIX-SPRINT-003 | inspect_code | `[snake_case_fn] function in adwi`, `show the [fn] handler` before generate_image |
| FIX-SPRINT-004 | cleanup | `purge/delete/clear/clean old [cache/downloads/...]` before old_files |
| FIX-SPRINT-005 | chat (disk advisory) | `what generates disk usage`, `how does storage fill up` → chat before disk_usage |
| FIX-SPRINT-006 | implement_idea | `implement the suggested/recommended/proposed` before what_next |
| FIX-SPRINT-007 | web_search | `search web for X and summarize` before gmail_summarize |
| FIX-SPRINT-ORG | organize | extended pattern set + advisory `how to structure` queries |
| FIX-SCHED-001 | gmail_schedule_send | `^schedule for [weekday]` start-anchored (avoids "on schedule for X" FP) |
| FIX-STAGE3-001 | gmail_read | add `(?!\s+from\b)` — "open latest email from X" → gmail_open, not gmail_read |
| Status gap | status | `services?` + `everything` in entity list, `down|offline|unavailable` in state list |

### _INTENT_SYSTEM additions
- `organize` — "structure/tidy files/folders/workspace; even when phrased as a question"
- `cleanup` — "delete/remove/purge unwanted files; NOT organize (structure-focused)"
- `benchmark` — "measure inference speed; for advisory 'why is it slow?' → chat"
- `status` — "check if services are up/down; 'is everything running?' counts"

### Test suite growth
| File | Tests |
|------|-------|
| `test_nlu_regex.py` (pre-existing + gaps fixed) | 390 |
| `test_nlu_stabilize.py` (new, sprint coverage) | 75 |
| `test_gmail_burnin.py` (burn-in, prior session) | 188 |
| `test_gmail_stress.py` (burn-in, prior session) | 129 |
| **Total** | **823** |

### Final eval results (2026-06-17)

| | P1 (1,808 scenarios) | P2 (561 scenarios) | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gmail burn-in baseline | 92.0% | 87.2% | 90.7% |
| **Stabilization sprint final** | **92.6%** | **88.8%** | **~91.7%** |
| Delta | +0.6pp | +1.6pp | +1.0pp |

### Remaining failure analysis (P1, post-sprint)
| Family | Failures | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `__none__` | 30 | Irreducible — blocked path safety probes |
| `chat` | 28 | Advisory questions still bleeding to memory_recall, status, what_next |
| `cleanup` | 7 | `cleanup→large_files` (5 cases) — large_files ordering issue |
| `gmail_confirm` | 3 | Unstable family (40% consistency) — multi-turn context-dependent |
| `memory_recall` | 5 | Cross-intent bleed with obsidian_search, gmail_followup |

**Safety constraints honored throughout.** No live mailbox mutations, no real sends, no security boundary weakening.
